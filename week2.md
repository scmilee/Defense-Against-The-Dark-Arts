# Week 2- Advanced Foresics

## Ideas

This week was entirely centered around Malware, from its origins to various types, naming conventions and tools of the trade.

#### Types:
- **Viruses**: There are three classifications that fall under the virus category, and a virus can be one or more of these three: parasitic, ploymorphic, and worms. Parasitic viruses rely on other files to  perform their tasks. Polymorphic viruses change their content structure and or name in order to thwart hash based detection. Worms are viruses that are hell bent on spreading themselves across the world.
- **Tojans**: There are four classifications for trojans that were discussed. First is the backdoor, which is designed to open up a port on your machine to the outside world, the damage this can cause depends on the port and your system. A downloader/dropper which is a piece of malware you'd get from clicking on a sketchy link or e-mail. A bot is a mini process that awaits commands from an outside source, this is where the term bot-net comes from. Finally, there's keyloggers, which log all activity on your computer and send it off to the bad guys (or good guys?).
- **PUPs**: Potentially unwanted programs. Things like adware and spyware are classified under this term, and funnily enough a lot of the adware and spyware were just garbage AV programs due to the insane amount of permissions those programs get.

#### Procedures:

#### RFC- 3227
Naming a new sample from either your work place or from personal endeavours tends to follow a naming convention if you want the name you give your piece of malware to stick. The convention typically follows :
`Type/platform/Family/Variant/!information`
so an example using the Zues virus family on the Macos platform would be :
`Virus/MacOS/Zues/.Y/!PGK`

#### Tools
- **Yara Signatures**- a method of identifying Malware using checksums generated by hashing algortihms like MD5, SHA1, and my favorite SHA256. There's also the mention of Imp-hashing or import hashing that hashes the files imports and checks those against known threats.  I use sha 2 256 at my work in a very similar manner so it's awesome to see it being used in a totally different environment.
- **Volatility**- a program that prevents all programs from exiting normally.

- **FTK Imager**- similar to task manager but on steroids, allowing for granular manipulation of your systems processes.

Similar to last week where there was a dyanamic duo of technology, the dynamic duo of this week was clearly Yara and Volatility. Where you could get the memory dump using Volatility then do signature checking against it to quickly identify and known suspicious behavior. 

## Fun Facts Learned
- Mac times
- Hashing of images to prevent emotional burnout in human trafficking cases. 
- A lot of passwords/secrets are stored in memory and can be viewed inside of a memory dump.
- Locards Exchange Principle.
