# Week 2- Advanced Foresics

## Ideas

This week was centered around forensics, reverse engineering and common practices of a forensic investigator.
There are many reasons to hire/need a forensic investigator but the following 5 reasons are most common:
- Unauthorized data access(hackers)
- Fraudulent activity
- IP theft
- Human Exploitation
- Inappropirate use of internet(NSFW activites at work)

#### Types of Forensics:
- **Live**: The suspects device is currently on whether at the scene of the crime or cryogenically frozen and brought to a lab. This device still has all of its RAM untouched (mostly) and can have a memory dump performed on it to get all volatile data off of it. This is usually best case scenario as memory dumps contain a lot of useful information like the master page table, secrets etc. 
- **Post-mortem**: This is the less ideal situation but still can be very fruitful if you know what you're doing. This is an investigation into the main storage component of the suspects device, but in some cases can be an investigstion into perihperal devices as well(as long as they're non-volatile). Given todays growing storage sizes (1TB +), there is an increasing amount of data to process in the same time-span as 10 + years ago. This has lead investigators to exploiting hashing to quickly compare contents of files against known exploitive content/IP. 
- **Network Based**: This is often a pre-cursor to a live or post-mortem investigation and can be performed without direct access to the suspects computer. It montiors activity through firewalls, routers, ISP datalogs etc.

#### Procedures:
The main workflow of an investigation follows these three steps- evidence aquisition -> investigation and analyses -> reporting. But it's not as simple as it may seem, because not only do you have to translate a complex topic into something a layman can understand, but at the same time you must not ruin the investigation by mistake. 


#### RFC- 3227


#### Tools
- **Yara**- a method of identifying Malware using checksums generated by hashing algortihms like MD5, SHA1, and my favorite SHA256. There's also the mention of Imp-hashing or import hashing that hashes the files imports and checks those against known threats.  I use sha 2 256 at my work in a very similar manner so it's awesome to see it being used in a totally different environment.

- **Volatility**- a program that prevents all programs from exiting normally.

- **FTK Imager**- similar to task manager but on steroids, allowing for granular manipulation of your systems processes.

Similar to last week where there was a dyanamic duo of technology, the dynamic duo of this week was clearly Yara and Volatility. Where you could get the memory dump using Volatility then do signature checking against it to quickly identify and known suspicious behavior. 

## Fun Facts Learned
- Mac times
- Hashing of images to prevent emotional burnout in human trafficking cases. 
- A lot of passwords/secrets are stored in memory and can be viewed inside of a memory dump.
- Locards Exchange Principle.
