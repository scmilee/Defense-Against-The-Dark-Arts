# Week 1- Malware Basics

## Ideas

This week was entirely centered around Malware, from its origins to various types, naming conventions and tools of the trade.

#### Types:
- **Viruses**: There are three classifications that fall under the virus category, and a virus can be one or more of these three: parasitic, ploymorphic, and worms. Parasitic viruses rely on other files to  perform their tasks. Polymorphic viruses change their content structure and or name in order to thwart hash based detection. Worms are viruses that are hell bent on spreading themselves across the world.
- **Tojans**: There are four classifications for trojans that were discussed. First is the backdoor, which is designed to open up a port on your machine to the outside world, the damage this can cause depends on the port and your system. A downloader/dropper which is a piece of malware you'd get from clicking on a sketchy link or e-mail. A bot is a mini process that awaits commands from an outside source, this is where the term bot-net comes from. Finally, there's keyloggers, which log all activity on your computer and send it off to the bad guys (or good guys?).
- **PUPs**: Potentially unwanted programs. Things like adware and spyware are classified under this term, and funnily enough a lot of the adware and spyware were just garbage AV programs due to the insane amount of permissions those programs get.
